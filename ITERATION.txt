Player Respawn: Player respawn is on a timer (want to make it a purchasable in future iterations)

Guidance: Added pop-up text to the player that gives them an idea of what everything on the map does

Inconsistent coin values: Fixed by debugging (system was spawning a coin for every zombie alive at the time of one death)

Enemy vs Towers (same color): Changed the wall to be an orange color (future sprite upgrades coming)

Boring Combat: No longer can kill without clicking, much more active

Players and Managers dependency: For nukes and future items, the action goes manager -> player -> manager through a system where the manager drops in 
the first stage of an item, the player picks it up and does something, and then the manager can use the final item

Theming: Made the enemies zombies, more blood / gore, will need to do more of this in the future (Want to get to an apocalyptic world where it's 
robot vs zombies)

Walls to weak: Up'd the health to make it so it takes some time to destroy the walls

Damage indication: Player indication is a blood flash, enemy indication is in the form of a health bar
