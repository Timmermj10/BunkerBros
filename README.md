This is my personal repository for the game that I designed and developed as my final project in EECS494 Game Development and Design. 

This was the third project in a three project sequence for EECS494, where we were tasked with designing and developing a game from scratch in Unity using C# as the development language.

The project took six weeks to complete and has hundred of man hours put into it. This is by far the hardest I have ever worked on a project, and while the final product isn't exactly what I had hoped for, I am still very proud of what I accomplished with the iteration of the project.
